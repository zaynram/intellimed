Subjective:    
Keith is a 44 year old male who presents for evaluation of continued pain in R shoudler and upper back.  Pain 
is primarily with lifting in the R back shoulder area.  He was in a MVA on 2/2, seen in ED on 2/3.  No fractures, 
started on flexeril.  States pain was tolerable with this, but he is out and having more discomfort now.  Does 
need work not for his FMLA through 2/21.  
Denies new injury or worsening symptoms.  
I have reviewed the nurse's notes, patient vitals, allergies, past medical history and medications.
Objective: 
BP 122/72  | Pulse 63  | Resp 18  | Wt 95.3 kg (210 lb) 
General:  Well-developed, well-nourished. No acute distress.
Head: atraumatic
Musculoskeletal:  FROM R shoulder, neg impingement and empty can tests, NV intact. TTP over inner 
scapula area. 
Spine: no thoracic spinal TTP or stepoff.  No paraspinal mm tenderness. 
Skin: warm and dry. No rashes. No associated open skin abrasions. 
Imaging:
Na
 
Assessment:
Right shoulder strain
Plan:
Reviewed ED records from 2/3, no concerning findings - I do not feel repeat imaging indicated at this time.  
Can try NSAIDs, q6, add tizanidine in place of flexeril and consider PT if not improving.  Indications for return 
were discussed and Keith will return to clinic or emergency department if symptoms worsen or do not improve.
