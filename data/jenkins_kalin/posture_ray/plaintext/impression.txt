Impressions and Assessment
The posterior tangent method of radiographic analysis has been studied extensively for both validity and reliability[1;2-5],
and has been shown to be a superior method of analysis for biomechanical assessment over the Cobb method of x-ray
analysis for sagittal cervical spine.[3]  Using this radiographic analysis technique, the normal cervical lordosis measured
from C2-C7 for a normal average population was found to measure -34º with ideal alignment measuring  -42º.[1;2]  (Note
that the negative sign preceding the measurement of degree indicates direction, thus the normal Lordotic/extended
position and an abnormal flexion angle/kyphosis is noted by a positive angle). There is a statistically significant
association between cervical pain and lordosis < -20º and a "clinically normal" range for cervical lordosis of -31º to -
40º.[6]
As noted in this computerized analysis, Ms. KALIN JENKINS's cervical spine measures -17.3º. According to recent
research, Ms. KALIN JENKINS's cervical spine alignment is predictive of chronic neck pain.[1] This is a loss from the
expected normal lordosis by 58.8%.  Regarding anterior cervical translation (weight bearing) findings of less than 15mm
has been established as a normal.[1;2]  Ms. KALIN JENKINS has an abnormal anterior cervical translation from C2
relative to C7 of 37.7mm.

Impressions and Assessment
The posterior tangent method of radiographic analysis has been studied extensively for both validity and reliability[4-8],
and has been shown to be a superior method of analysis for biomechanical assessment over the Cobb method of x-ray
analysis for sagittal cervical spine.[6]  Normal values for intersegmental motion should not exceed more than 10-11º of
angular motion.[9]  Using the posterior tangent method of radiographic analysis, motion that exceeds 10º has been
shown to predict and discriminate minor ligamentous injuries from those patients with true whiplash type ligamentous
injuries.[3]  Corroborating these findings using another method of analysis (inferior endplate assessment), an alteration
of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) has been defined as motion at the level in question that is more than 11º greater
than at either adjacent level.[1]  Regarding segmental translational movements, authors have noted that subluxation
should be noted with a range of 1.0-3.0mm[2] of intersegmental movement with absolute clinical cutoff threshold value of
3.5mm.[1;9]
There is anterior widening of the intervertebral disc space at C2-C3 levels evidenced by excessive segmental
extension, which indicates possible damage to the anterior longitudinal ligament and/or intervertebral disc at said level.
Segmental flexion instability is noted at the following segments: none
Segmental extension instability is noted at the following segments:  C2-C3 of -12.4º.
Segmental subluxation for flexion is noted at the following segments:  C6-C7 with -1.6 mm.
Segmental subluxation for extension is noted at the following segments:  C2-C3 with -1.7 mm, C5-C6 with -2.0 mm,
C6-C7 with -1.0 mm.
Segmental translational instability for flexion is noted at the following segments: none
Segmental translational instability for extension is noted at the following segments: none
According to the above biomechanical assessment, there are findings of alteration of motion segment integrity
(AOMSI) at the following levels: C2-C3.  Consequently, this patient may be rateable for a permanent injury upon
reaching maximal medical improvement.

Impressions and Assessment
As noted above in the table, Ms. KALIN JENKINS’s cervical spine
is translated (listed) from plumb by 0.5 mm to the right. Of
importance is that the patient has a mid neck abnormal angle of 5.1
degrees to the right. The patient has an angular displacement from
normal (plumb) of the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine of 2.9
degrees to the left.
