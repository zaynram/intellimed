X-RAY Instability Analysis
Lateral Cervical Flexion/Extension
Name: KALIN JENKINS
X-Ray was obtained: 12/14/2024
Date of Digitization: 2/7/2025
Date of Birth: 6/26/1999
Ms. KALIN JENKINS’s x-rays were analyzed utilizing the PostureRay® computerized X-ray digitizing system with impressions interpreted by JOHN A.
AIKENHEAD, DC,DACBR. X-Ray digitization for spinal biomechanics has been shown to be valid when compared to standard hand drawn methods.
The patient’s findings were then compared to established normals at each level and then globally. The X-Ray mensuration method used in analyzing
this patient have been studied for reliability and validity and these results are as follows:

Direction of measured displacements are indicated using the right-hand Cartesian coordinate system method in biomechanics. Consequently a "-"
negative sign preceding a measured value indicates posterior translation for linear movements; and a "-" preceding angular measurements indicate
relative segmental or global extension rotational movement.

Impressions and Assessment
The Endplate Analysis for this area of the spine (constructing tangential lines from inferior vertebrae C2-7) has been
noted in the scientific literature for objective analysis of vertebral segmental alignment in the neutral, flexion, and
extension views.[5]  This method was adopted by the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as a
method to discriminate an alteration of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) suggestive of an unstable spine[1;5].  AOMSI
has been defined as abnormal motion equal to or exceeding 11° of angular movement and/or 3.5mm of translational
slippage (break in "George's Line") relative to adjacent vertebral segments.[1;5]  Such excessive movement is indicative
of ligamentous sub-failure as well as possible disc damage.  Consequently, a patient may be rateable for a permanent
injury upon reaching maximal medical improvement should these alterations of spinal biomechanics persist.[1]
Regarding the magnitude of translational slippage (break in "George's Line") other researchers have argued that 3.5mm
is simply too large of a displacement of magnitude seldom observed in clinical practice [4] and that clinical relevance
should be noted at motion ranging from lower thresholds of 1.0-3.0mm indicating subluxation.[3]  Others have noted, “To
adopt 3.5mm of translation as the minimum criterion for anterior subluxation is to leave the majority of mild to moderate
instability unclassified.”[2]
In the flexion position, there are no ratable levels for angular instability nor for translational instability. Threshold for
angular excursion should not exceed 11° more than adjacent levels. Also noted in this global flexed position is
subluxation (break in "George's Line") of  C6-C7 with -1.6 mm.  Absolute threshold cutoff is defined by the AMA Guides
as translation slippage (break in "George's Line") of greater than 3.5mm.   In this position, there are no ratable levels of
abnormal translational slippage instability (break in "George's Line").

X-RAY Instability Analysis
Lateral Cervical Flexion/Extension
In the extension position, there are some ratable levels for angular instability but no ratable levels for translational
instability. Increase in angulation is noted at  C6-C7 of -18.2º compared to C5-C6 of -1.1º which is > 11º difference at
17.1º which is abnormal. Threshold for angular excursion should not exceed 11° more than adjacent levels. Also noted
in this global extended position is subluxation (break in "George's Line") of  C2-C3 with -1.7 mm, C5-C6 with -2.0 mm,
C6-C7 with -1.0 mm.  Absolute threshold cutoff is defined by the AMA Guides as translation slippage (break in
"George's Line") of greater than 3.5mm.   In this position, there are no ratable levels of abnormal translational slippage
instability (break in "George's Line").
Using the Penning system of analysis[6], Ms. KALIN JENKINS's cervical spine was analyzed using computerized
method and total motion at each segmental level was assessed.  Penning’s Analysis for cervical spine stability has
been shown to be one of the most valid methods for assessing total range of motion from flexion to extension.[5] Ms.
KALIN JENKINS was found to not have excessive motion exceeding normal ranges found in the literature.  At no levels
did the total motion exceed that of normal ranges found by Dvorak[5] and Wu[7].
According to the above biomechanical assessment, there are findings of alteration of motion segment integrity
(AOMSI) at the following levels: C6-C7.  Consequently, this patient may be ratable for a permanent injury upon
reaching maximal medical improvement.
