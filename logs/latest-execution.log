There is a statistically significant\nassociation between cervical pain and lordosis < -20\u00ba and a \"clinically normal\" range for cervical lordosis of -31\u00ba to -\n40\u00ba.[6]\nAs noted in this computerized analysis, Ms. KALIN JENKINS's cervical spine measures -17.3\u00ba. According to recent\nresearch, Ms. KALIN JENKINS's cervical spine alignment is predictive of chronic neck pain.[1] This is a loss from the\nexpected normal lordosis by 58.8%.  Regarding anterior cervical translation (weight bearing) findings of less than 15mm\nhas been established as a normal.[1;2]  Ms. KALIN JENKINS has an abnormal anterior cervical translation from C2\nrelative to C7 of 37.7mm.\n\u00a9 PostureCo, Inc.

AOMSI\nhas been defined as abnormal motion equal to or exceeding 11\u00b0 of angular movement and/or 3.5mm of translational\nslippage (break in \"George's Line\") relative to adjacent vertebral segments.[1;5]  Such excessive movement is indicative\nof ligamentous sub-failure as well as possible disc damage.  Consequently, a patient may be rateable for a permanent\ninjury upon reaching maximal medical improvement should these alterations of spinal biomechanics persist.[1]\nRegarding the magnitude of translational slippage (break in \"George's Line\") other researchers have argued that 3.5mm\nis simply too large of a displacement of magnitude seldom observed in clinical practice [4] and that clinical relevance\nshould be noted at motion ranging from lower thresholds of 1.0-3.0mm indicating subluxation.[3]  Others have noted, \u201cTo\nadopt 3.5mm of translation as the minimum criterion for anterior subluxation is to leave the majority of mild to moderate\ninstability unclassified.\u201d[2]\nIn the flexion position, there are no ratable levels for angular instability nor for translational instability. Threshold for\nangular excursion should not exceed 11\u00b0 more than adjacent levels. Also noted in this global flexed position is\nsubluxation (break in \"George's Line\") of  C6-C7 with -1.6 mm.  Absolute threshold cutoff is defined by the AMA Guides\nas translation slippage (break in \"George's Line\") of greater than 3.5mm.   In this position, there are no ratable levels of\nabnormal translational slippage instability (break in \"George's Line\").\n\u00a9 PostureCo, Inc.

Increase in angulation is noted at  C6-C7 of -18.2\u00ba compared to C5-C6 of -1.1\u00ba which is > 11\u00ba difference at\n17.1\u00ba which is abnormal. Threshold for angular excursion should not exceed 11\u00b0 more than adjacent levels. Also noted\nin this global extended position is subluxation (break in \"George's Line\") of  C2-C3 with -1.7 mm, C5-C6 with -2.0 mm,\nC6-C7 with -1.0 mm.  Absolute threshold cutoff is defined by the AMA Guides as translation slippage (break in\n\"George's Line\") of greater than 3.5mm.   In this position, there are no ratable levels of abnormal translational slippage\ninstability (break in \"George's Line\").\nUsing the Penning system of analysis[6], Ms. KALIN JENKINS's cervical spine was analyzed using computerized\nmethod and total motion at each segmental level was assessed.  Penning\u2019s Analysis for cervical spine stability has\nbeen shown to be one of the most valid methods for assessing total range of motion from flexion to extension.[5] Ms.\nKALIN JENKINS was found to not have excessive motion exceeding normal ranges found in the literature.  At no levels\ndid the total motion exceed that of normal ranges found by Dvorak[5] and Wu[7].\nAccording to the above biomechanical assessment, there are findings of alteration of motion segment integrity\n(AOMSI) at the following levels: C6-C7.  Consequently, this patient may be ratable for a permanent injury upon\nreaching maximal medical improvement.\nReferences\n[1]\nGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.American Medical Association, 2000.\n[2]\nForeman SM CAC.
